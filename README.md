# Spell Check Whole Page
Run spell check on all text layers in the page.

Displays a basic panel that allows users to replace the misspelled word or add it to the dictionary, or ignore it.

Uses OSX's built-in spelling features and dictionary to do this.

## Change Log

### 1.2.2 Checking auto-updating functionality
### 1.2.1 Add auto-update support
### 1.2.0 Bug fix (removing a deprecated function) and adding scrolling text view
### 1.1 Support for text within symbol overrides
### 1.0 Support for correcting misspellings
### 0.5 Detects and lists misspellings

## The problem
Spell check isn't available for all text layers at a time. If you're using sketch as a replacement for illustrator or inDesign, you really miss the ability to automatically spell check everything everywhere.

## Usage
**To install it, simply [download the zip](https://github.com/tallwave/sketch-spellcheck-all-layers/archive/master.zip) and double-click the “.sketchplugin” file.** You can access the plugin via the plugins menu. You’ll know its worked when you see the notification at the bottom of the screen.

Here’s a screen capture of the plugin in action:
